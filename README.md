Memorial for David C Price <br>
Created by his daughter, Sally Kalifa

I'm creating this website because my brother and I were so devastated in our dad's sudden passing from complications caused by covid, we forgot to do an obituary for him.  What made it even more devastating, was that we also lost our older sister Susie just nine days before him, also from covid.  I will also create a memorial for her as well in the future.
